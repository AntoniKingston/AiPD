# Sound Analysis and Processing

Elective course taking place in 2025L semester

## Project 1. - Time domain signal analysis app

### Functionalities

- **technical**
  - working with .wav files
  - possibility to choose a frame to analyze
    
- **plotting**
  - time domain plot
  - silent fragment marking
  - voiced fragment marking
  - ACF and AMDF plots
    
- **calculated parameters**
  - volume
  - STE
  - ZCR
  - SR
   
## Project 2. - Frequency domain signal analysis app

### Functionalities

- **technical**
  - working with .wav files
  - possibility to choose a frame to analyze by mouse dragging

- **plotting**
  - time domain plot
  - frequency domain plot
  - plot of both above on selcected subsection
  - spectrogram
  - fundamental frequency extracted using cepstrum
  - 
  **calculated parameters**
  - volume
  - FC
  - BW
  - BE and ERSB
  - SFM
  - SCF

  **parameter tweaking**
    - window functions (triangular, hamming, hanning, blackman)
    - frequency range
    - frame length
    - frame overlap
## Additional info

Both apps use PyQt python framework, detailed specification is included in respective requirements.txt files
